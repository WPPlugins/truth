Automatically links to Bible verses throughout your site.

== Description ==

The Truth plugin will scan the content of your posts, pages, comments, and widgets for references to Bible verses and can generate two types of links from these references.

= bibles.org =
Truth utilizes the [highlighter tool](http://tools.bibles.org/highlighter.html "bibles.org Highlighter Tool") from [bibles.org](http://bibles.org "BibleSearch") to generates links that, when clicked, will display a modal containing the verse that has been referenced. The following Bible versions are currently supported:

* Amplified Bible (AMP)
* The Holy Bible: American Standard Version (ASV)
* Contemporary English Version (US Version) (CEV)
* Contemporary English Version (US Version) (CEVD)
* Contemporary English Version (CEVUS06)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I display a pop-up bubble showing the text of the passage? =

As of Truth v2.0, you can display a modal when utilizing Bibles.org Highlighter as your Bible service. Due to the Terms of Use for YouVersion and lack of an API, the plugin is not able to publicly display works based on YouVersion.

= How do I define my shortcode? =

`[truth version="nkjv"]2 Corinthians 1:20[/truth]`

= Can the Truth plugin be used on a multisite install? =

Yes. Upload `truth.php` to `/wp-content/mu-plugins/` (auto-enables use on every site) or upload the `truth` directory to `/wp-content/plugins/` and manage through your plugin menu.

= How do I authorize use on all sites of a multisite install? =

In the plugin file (line 22), set `define( TRUTH_AUTH_ALL, TRUE );`
